# Selenium Hybrid Framework for Ecommerce Website Automation using PageObjects and Page Factory Design Pattern

Welcome to the **Selenium Hybrid Framework** for automating Ecommerce website testing. This comprehensive framework encompasses various advanced concepts in test automation, ensuring efficient and maintainable test suites. With a focus on data-driven testing, Page Object Model (POM), Page Factory design pattern, and integration with popular tools, this framework provides a robust foundation for your automation needs.

## Key Features

- **Data-Driven Testing:** Harness the power of data-driven testing by seamlessly integrating test data with your automation scripts. This allows for greater coverage and versatility in your test scenarios.

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Implement the POM design pattern to enhance the maintainability and reusability of your automation code. Separate web elements and their interactions from test logic, promoting cleaner and more organized scripts.

- **Page Factory Design Pattern:** Leverage the Page Factory design pattern to optimize the initialization of web elements on your pages. This pattern enhances performance and reduces the complexity of element management.

- **Maven Integration:** Manage project dependencies and build automation with Maven. The included `pom.xml` file streamlines the setup process and ensures consistent test execution across environments.

- **TestNG Annotations:** Utilize TestNG annotations to define the sequence and behavior of your test methods. This ensures proper test execution order and facilitates parallel test runs.

- **Extent Reports:** Generate detailed and visually appealing test reports using Extent Reports. These reports offer valuable insights into test results, aiding in quick identification of issues.

- **Jenkins Integration:** Achieve continuous integration by seamlessly integrating the framework with Jenkins. This enables automated test execution and reporting within your CI/CD pipeline.

- **Git Version Control:** Maintain a clean and organized codebase using Git and GitHub. Track changes, collaborate with team members, and manage your automation scripts effectively.
